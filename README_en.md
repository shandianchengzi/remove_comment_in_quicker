# Remove Comments in Code

The repository was not intended to reinvent the wheel, but Quicker has more requirements for code removal, requiring single files and low versions, but I really want a feature that can be compatible with Quicker to remove comments from the code, so I can only do it myself. (Maybe some IDE or editor has this feature, but I don't know)
